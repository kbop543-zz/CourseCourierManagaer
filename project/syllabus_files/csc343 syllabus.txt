Academic Offenses: All of the work you submit must be done by you (individually or within

Please don’t cheat. It is unpleasant for everyone involved, including us. Here are a couple of 
general guidelines to help you avoid plagiarism: 
● Never look at another student’s work, on paper or on the computer screen. 
● Never show another student your work. This applies to all drafts of a solution and to 
incomplete solutions.
