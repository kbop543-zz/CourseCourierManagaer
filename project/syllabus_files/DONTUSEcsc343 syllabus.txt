Course Information Sheet

Information from us: The course website http://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc343h/winter is required reading. It contains assignment handouts and other essential material. The course discussion board is on Piazza. To save you time and ensure that you don't miss any critical information, we will create a short FAQ post for each assignment that summarizes key things that have come up in other threads, and we will pin this and any other essential threads at the top of the board. You are responsible for reading all of these pinned posts at least once a week. You can set up Piazza to send you a digest of recent posts at your desired frequency: Click the gear icon in the upper right corner, then "Account/Email Settings" in the drop-down.

Questions from you: Please use Piazza to ask questions about assignments and course lecture material so that everyone can benefit. For personal questions, email us from your UofT address. Please include "343" in the subject line and include your full name and UTORid in the body of the message.
We will try to respond to email and Piazza postings by the end of the next business day. However, it may take longer, especially near due dates. Try to start assignments early in case you have questions. If you do not hear back quickly, we are always available during office hours to help.
Prerequisites: Arts and Science students: If you don't have the course prerequisites listed in the calendar entry, contact Professor Horton immediately to see whether you may remain in the course. Include your name, student number, full academic history from Acorn, and why you feel you are well prepared to take the course. If we don't issue a waiver, the registrar will remove you from the course.
Engineering students: If you don't have the course prerequisites listed in your calendar, your registrar may not allow you to take the course without my permission. If so, email Professor Horton with your name, student number, full academic history from Acorn, and why you feel you are well prepared to take the course.
