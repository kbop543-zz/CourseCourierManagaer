Course Description (from the Calendar)
Standard algorithm design techniques: divide-and-conquer, greedy strategies, dynamic programming,
linear programming, randomization, network flows, approximation algorithms. Brief introduction
to NP-completeness: polynomial time reductions, examples of various NP-complete
problems, self-reducibility. Additional topics may include approximation and randomized algorithms.
Students will be expected to show good design principles and adequate skills at reasoning
about the correctness and complexity of algorithms.

Grading Scheme
Assignments: 3 worth 5% each
Term tests: 2 worth 20% each
Final (3 hours): worth 45%
See the course website for dates and deadlines. Term tests will be held during tutorial slots.
The 20% rule: you will receive 20% of the points for any (sub)problem for which you write
“I do not know how to answer this question.” You will receive 10% if you leave a question blank.
If instead you submit irrelevant or erroneous answers you will receive 0 points. You may receive
partial credit for the work that is clearly “on the right track.”1 The 20% rule applies to all term
work: assignments, term tests, and even the final.
Assignment Policy
Assignments will be submitted electronically on MarkUs (instructions will follow later). Late
assignments will not be accepted.
1The wording and the idea is due to Allan Borodin.

Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity
You are allowed to discuss assignment questions with other students. You are allowed to consult
additional materials, e.g., books, papers, websites. Nonetheless, the writeup of your solutions
should be your own and should be done in isolation from other students and resources. In addition,
you must clearly identify the names of students you collaborated with (if any) and provide a clear
description of additional materials you consulted (if any).
The following rule of thumb might help you ensure that you are writing down your own
understanding of a solution: (1) do not take notes during discussions with other students, (2)
after solving a question, take a one-hour break before writing down the solution, (3) while writing
down the solution do not consult any materials.
Copying or allowing other students to copy solutions is a serious academic offense and will be reported.
You might find the Arts and Science website on academic honesty (and references therein)
helpful: http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/newstudents/transition/academic/plagiarism.

Email Policy
I read email regularly, but I do NOT promise to reply to all emails. In particular, if your question
is of general interest, I will not respond to it via email. Instead, I will address your question during
the following lecture, so that everyone can benefit. Similarly, if your question requires a technical
answer it is better to ask it during a lecture, or a tutorial, or office hours.

Bulletin Board
The course bulletin board can be found at https://bb-2017-01.teach.cs.toronto.edu/c/
csc373. This bulletin board will NOT be monitored by the instructor or TAs. Course announcements
will be made either during lectures or on the course website.
Accessibility
Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if
you have a disability/health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to
