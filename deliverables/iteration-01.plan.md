# Mighty Moose

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: 2/2/2017 9:00 pm
 * End date: 2/6/2017

## Process

The main purpose of this meeting was to determine what our product for our project would be. We decided to build a course goal organizer. We also discussed potential meetup times, for both in person and online meetings. We discussed the languages everyone was familiar with and settled with doing a web application using Javascript, HTML,CSS, Java likely using the frameworks NodeJs and Ajax.

#### Roles & responsibilities

This is how the work was split up for team deliverable 1:
 * Filip will create an overall description of our product
 * Hari will create some sample profiles of the users our product is tailored to
 * Kyra will create some reasons for why users might want to use our product
 * John will compile a list of highlights of our decision making process
 * Jeremy will work on creating the plan.md and review.md
 * Taha will create some sample mockups of our product

#### Events
  * This meeting on February 2, 2017 was on Google Hangouts. The purpose was to vote among the ideas ,which we informally brainstormed about in the tutorial on our slack. We decided to build a course organizer. We clarified details about our product that would make it possible for each member to start their assigned part of team deliverable 1.
  * We decided on our next meeting to be Tuesday February 7, 2017 at the Bahen Centre. The purpose of this meeting would be to discuss our progress on the team deliverable. We would also discuss some potential features for our product and decide which ones are worth keeping or not doing. 
  * We discussed when we would have our review meeting which would be February 9, 2017. This is where we would hope to have finished each of our parts of the team deliverable and do a proof read and write up of the review meeting. 
  * Our future meetings would discuss the specifics on how the work for the project should be divided up banking on our individual team's strengths. This would result in describing milestones that we should achieve every week. We would have weekly meetings to discuss our progress.  
  * We settled that most of our future team meeetings will  be at the tutorial or on line because everyone's schedules clash for an in-person meeting outside of class times.
  * We also all agreed to use Slack to have improptu communication and ask questions when needed, rather than wait for the next meeting to clarify something.

#### Artifacts
    
* We will maintain google documents for each meeting. This was useful because all members of the team could add important details we discussed from each meeting. See artifact below.
* We will informally discuss features and ideas of our product using Slack.
* We will assign issues using the github issues feature. We will use this feature as we can assign certain issues to certain members
* We will also use Trello to create milestones of what we need to get done every week. Trello is useful because there is a slack plug in and we can break big tasks into smaller tasks.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

* Determine the features our application will have
* Determine how the UI will look
* Determine what APIs we will use to do gpa calculation and pdf parsing.
* Determine whether we should use an API or create an algorithm for calculating a grade via the percentage it is worth to a student
* Determine how the algorithm for creating suggested start times ,based on their course load, will work

#### Artifacts

* Determined Product Idea and Code base [(Notes Here)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WStC-LvLA7TRMHt6HLsg36zxYrUATyPOoTpAV7RrwE/edit?usp=sharingHere). This was useful as we were able to have a clear cut view of the ideas we brainstormed and how to narrow it down to one idea.
* Meeting notes were kept in google documents [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j4vA5vimymrt4uZKIJTnNMulQHtwNaPU9lpBt2W_QPc/edit). This was useful as we were able to easily keep track of anything that was talked about in the meetings. By using google documents, it also made it easy to share and edit the information written.
* We made a first iteration mockup [Here](https://marvelapp.com/2a3a6b6/screen/24775274). This mockup was useful as it helped us to decide on the features needed for our product and potential layouts for our web app.
