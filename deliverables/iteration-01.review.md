 * Where: Two people met at bahen, The rest of the group was on a google hangout

## Process - Reflection

For this first phase of the project we determined that our product would be a course goal organizer for students. We agreed on a rough sketch of what kind of features our product should have. We also brainstormed on some potential APIs that we should use. We also narrowed down the scope of our product to something feasible.

#### Decisions that turned out well


1. Using slack to coordinate between meetings and discuss potential ideas and product features worked well as everyone had busy schedules and it would have been difficult to plan several small meetings instead.
2. Dividing up the responsibilities and having interim meetings to check on everyone's progress turned out well because everyone completed their part on time.
3. Decided to include instructers in how our product will operate as to make our product more dynamic and interactive. If instructors can suggest start time for students then this can eliminate the need for an algorithm that would suggest start times for students based on their course load.
5. Managed to make the scope of the project by removing very complex problems to solve. We decided to eliminate some ideas that might have been too complex for us to achieve in the time assigned. This resulted in our team having a clear vision of the features that we want to get implemented.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. We had multiple team meetings online. However this did not turn out as well as we hoped because it was hard to coordinate with everyone's schedule on meet up times. It resulted in some confusion and disagreement about what the features of the product should be.
2. We discussed the possibility of building an algorithm that will suggest start times for a student to start working a course task. However, we are not sure if we should decide on this as it may be beyond the scope of our project. It might also be hard to decide how much time to allocate for a course task as every course has many variables to consider when it comes to how long it takes to complete an assignment. 


#### Planned changes

1. We will all make it a point to meet in tutorials in person. We are making this change as in-person meetings are easier to manage and it will be easier to hash out technical details, review code and discuss UI in person.
2. We will use git issues and trello to establish a technical workflow for the next iteration. This is because it will act as a guide for what we need to do and help us stay on track.



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
1. We determined what our product should be. We got approval from the TA and everyone in the team is confident in it and has agreed on the features it should have.
2. We completed all aspects of deliverable 1 with everyone working equally. This was completed because we had interim meetings to discuss our progress and talked informally on slack to ensure we were all on the same page.



#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
1. We have not met in person yet. This was not completed because everyone's schedules did not permit it.
2. We did not decide on which APIs to use for our product yet. This was not done because we decided we should get to it on our next iteration.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. We plan to use aspects of agile development more stringently in the future. Given how we had problems in the first iteration with aspects of planning, we will try to adhere to an established development platform t get things done more quickly and effectively.
2. We will start developing basic UI for the product. We want to ensure our product is also mobile responsive as the majority of students would probably use it on their phones. We need to ensure we can all agree on an interface.
3. We want to determine what APIs we will use to do gpa calculation and pdf parsing.
4. We want to determine whether we should use an API or create an algorithm for calculating student grades.
