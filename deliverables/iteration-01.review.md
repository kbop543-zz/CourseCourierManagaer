## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, February 9, 2017, 5 pm
 * Where: Bahen with some people online

## Process - Reflection

For this first phase of the project we determined that our product would be a pdf course reader for students and instructers and what the scope of it would be.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

1. Dividing up the responsibilities seem to turn out well because everyone completed their part on time.
2. Online meetings helped us communicate with each other around busy schedules.
3. Used slack to effectively talk to each other between meeting
4. Decided to include instructers in the decision making process.
5. Managed to make the scope of the project by removing very complex problems to solve (universal updates, smart planning)

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
1. Have not had an in person meeting where everyone was present yet
2. Planned for multiple in-person meetings that did not occur
3. Confusion about what our project actually was for a portion of the iteration.


#### Planned changes

1. Everyone meets in person as soon as possible, make it a point to meet in tutorials
2. Use git issues to set goals to divide responsibilities and track progress as currently we have no method of tracking progress right now.
3. Establish a technical workflow for next iteration as currently things.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
1. Determined our product (Got approval from the TA and everyone in the team is confident it)
2. Completed all aspects of deliverable one with everyone working equally.
3. We had many productive meetings online.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
1. We have not met in person yet
2. Some tasks were delayed and required more work than we would like to do in the future.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
1. We plan to use aspects of agile development more stringently in the future. Given how we had problems in the first iteration with aspects of planning adhering to an established development platform can help get things done more quickly and effectively.
2. We will start developing basic UI and writing code for the product. The main goal here is to have a presentable product to show for our efforts.
